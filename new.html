          "Heyyy Beautiful, it's me, your PANDEY JI... <br />
          You know, it's my first time writing a letter for anyone apart from those 
          letters to invite your cousin for birthday party &#128514; &#128514; &#128514; 
          So please don't mind if I make some mistakes while writing this. 
          You know, when we started talking to each other and getting to know each other better, 
          many times I came to the conclusion that you are fake."
