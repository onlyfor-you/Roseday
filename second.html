          "So I always wanted someone like you in my life, but when I was about
          to get it, I couldn't believe if this was real or just God playing
          with my heart. I didn't rush; I took my time to know you more and
          more. Interestingly, the more I learned about you, the more I fell in
          love with you. You know, I always tell you, 'Please don't show care and love
          for me; I don't want it or I don't deserve it.' All of this and many
          more things like that were just to make sure that God isn't playing
          with me. <br>
          I always knew that one day I would get a girl whom I would
          proudly call my girlfriend in front of the whole world."
